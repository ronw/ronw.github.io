I'm currently a software engineer at [[http://g.co/brain][Google Brain]].  While at [[http://research.google.com/pubs/RonWeiss.html][Google]]
I've worked on noise robust speech recognition and music
recommendation, among other things.  Previously, I was a postdoc
working on music information retrieval with [[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~jb2843/][Juan Bello]] at [[http://marl.smusic.nyu.edu][MARL]] at [[http://www.nyu.edu][NYU]].
Earlier still, I was a graduate research assistant working with
[[http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/][Dan Ellis]] in the Laboratory for the Recognition and Organization of
Speech and Audio ([[http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/][LabROSA]]).  I defended my [[pubs/ronw-thesis.pdf][dissertation]] in May 2009
(watch me write it at about 50,000 * real-time [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FsO6m77vlE][here]]).

My research interests lie at the intersection of audio signal
processing and machine learning.  My dissertation research was devoted
to [[index#pubs][model based source separation]], but I also found time to do a bit of
[[http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/meapsoft][music signal analysis]] to create some [[http://www.meapsoft.com/showcase.php][wacky remixes]] on the side.  I've
also done some work on music information retrieval.  You can find
more (outdated) information on my [[projects]] page.

You might also be interested in some of my freely available [[http://github.com/ronw/][code]],
including assorted Python [[http://github.com/ronw/frontend][audio]] [[http://github.com/ronw/gm][processing]] [[http://github.com/ronw/daap-player][modules]], and useful Matlab
tools for [[http://github.com/ronw/celltools][functional programming]], [[http://ronw.github.com/plottools/][easier plotting]], [[http://github.com/ronw/matlab_hmm][training GMMs/HMMs]],
and [[http://github.com/ronw/matlab_htk/][interfacing]] with [[http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk][HTK]].  I've also spent some time hacking on the
[[http://bitbucket.org/ronw/gordon][Gordon music database]] and [[http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/][scikits.learn]].

; Ron obtained his B.S. in computer engineering 2004 and his M.S. in
; electrical engineering in 2005, both from Columbia's illustrious
; [[http://www.engineering.columbia.edu][FFSEAS]].

; Among other things, Ron enjoys electrical engineering, long walks on
; the beach, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_posting][bottom posting]], [[http://www.emacswiki.org/][emacs]], pointless boycotts, and writing
; about himself in the third person.
